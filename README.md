### Java ☕🫘

My journey with Java has just started. Apart from passing the Java SE 8 Programmer I Exam there's a few added tools that go into forming a decent junior fullstack software developer. Luckily for me my interpersonal skills require less attention, allowing the focus to be on getting my hands dirty. Here's cheeky Magic trick to show it's not all smoke and mirrors...

### Magic Trick
```java


public class Magic {
	public static void main(String[] args) {

int myNumber = 786;

int stepOne = myNumber * myNumber;

int stepTwo = stepOne + myNumber;

int stepThree = stepTwo / myNumber;

int stepFour = stepThree + 17;

int stepFive = stepFour - myNumber;

int stepSix = stepFive / 6;

System.out.println(stepSix);
		

	}
}

```

### Movement

Running, and movement on the whole, is a huge part of my life. Many modern jobs are 'office' based and often dont see us moving enough throughout the day. I advocate for a minimlaistic lifestyle that incorporates natural movement in all tasks. Conscious practices and protocols for healthier more effective movement, a significant focus is placed on breathing. Teaching and mastering various breathing rythms for outcomes such as control, healing, power, and recovery. Specialized recovery protocols have been refined and developed through years of experience to yield immediate to long term results.
